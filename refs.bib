  abstract   = {Datalog has been applied to several use cases that require very high performance on large rulesets and factsets. It is common to create indexes for relations to improve search performance. However, the existing indexing schemes either require manual index selection or result in insufficient performance on very large tasks. In this paper, we propose an automatic scheme to select indexes. We automatically create the minimum number of indexes to speed up all the searches in a given Datalog program. We have integrated our indexing scheme into an open-source Datalog engine SOUFFL\'{E}. We obtain performance on a par with what users have accepted from hand-optimized Datalog programs running on state-of-the-art Datalog engines, while we do not require the effort of manual index selection. Extensive experiments on large real Datalog programs demonstrate that our indexing scheme results in considerable speedups (up to 2x) and significantly less memory usage (up to 6x) compared with other automated index selections.},

  abstract  = {From the Publisher:Over the past two decades, the theory concerning the logical level of database management systems has matured and become an elegant and robust piece of science. Foundations of Databases presents indepth coverage of this theory and surveys several emerging topics. Written by three leading researchers, this advanced text presents a unifying and contemporary perspective on the field. A major effort in writing the book has been to highlight the intuitions behind the theoretical development.}

  abstract   = {The B-tree and its variants have been found to be highly useful (both theoretically and in practice) for storing large amounts of information, especially on secondary storage devices. We examine the problem of overcoming the inherent difficulty of concurrent operations on such structures, using a practical storage model. A single additional “link” pointer in each node allows a process to easily recover from tree modifications performed by other concurrent processes. Our solution compares favorably with earlier solutions in that the locking scheme is simpler (no read-locks are used) and only a (small) constant number of nodes are locked by any update process at any given time. An informal correctness proof for our system is given.},
