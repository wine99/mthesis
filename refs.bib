  abstract  = {From the Publisher:Over the past two decades, the theory concerning the logical level of database management systems has matured and become an elegant and robust piece of science. Foundations of Databases presents indepth coverage of this theory and surveys several emerging topics. Written by three leading researchers, this advanced text presents a unifying and contemporary perspective on the field. A major effort in writing the book has been to highlight the intuitions behind the theoretical development.}

  abstract   = {The B-tree and its variants have been found to be highly useful (both theoretically and in practice) for storing large amounts of information, especially on secondary storage devices. We examine the problem of overcoming the inherent difficulty of concurrent operations on such structures, using a practical storage model. A single additional “link” pointer in each node allows a process to easily recover from tree modifications performed by other concurrent processes. Our solution compares favorably with earlier solutions in that the locking scheme is simpler (no read-locks are used) and only a (small) constant number of nodes are locked by any update process at any given time. An informal correctness proof for our system is given.},
