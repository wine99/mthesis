  abstract  = {From the Publisher:Over the past two decades, the theory concerning the logical level of database management systems has matured and become an elegant and robust piece of science. Foundations of Databases presents indepth coverage of this theory and surveys several emerging topics. Written by three leading researchers, this advanced text presents a unifying and contemporary perspective on the field. A major effort in writing the book has been to highlight the intuitions behind the theoretical development.}
